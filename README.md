# Teakettle Experimental Forest
=========

 The following scrips are to assess the impact of forest management (fire, thinning, and their interaction) on evolutionary processes that affect fitness, such as mating system, effective pollen pools, etc, in a mid-elevational mixed-conifer forest in the central Sierra Nevada mountains of California. 

 The first scripts are used to estimate parentage, within and across experimental plots, and the dispersal kernels for both pollen and seed. This information will inform impact on evolutionary processes affecting fitness.
